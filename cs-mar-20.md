### Nerves interviewing
* it is a challenge!
* self-awareness is good
    * know about my weakness
    * take a logical approach
    * think of it like a programmer!
        * where are the 'bugs' in my interview 'programming'
        * what's the fix: lots of practice (mock/self), figure out where i get caught up
* it's okay to be nervous!!
* interviews are kind of phony, it's built into the process
* sometimes it's okay to be transparent
    * 'im having trouble stating my passion here'
    
### How to I combat the impostor syndrome?
* skills! practice! PORTFOLIO!
* meetups/networking
    * will help feel like I know a lot and belong with peers
    * will also highlight what I need to learn
* as best as possible, trust your skills and personal qualities

#### Go to Meetups and Present
* makes you feel like a developer
* practice pitching
* reminds you that you've done work, and that makes you a developer

### Interview Failing
* you WILL fail!
* rejection is painful, but it doesn't last forever
* even the best developers get rejected
* congratulate yourself! you went out there and tried
    * growth mindset - if you realized something you need to learn, let that motivate you to learn it
* after a terrible interview, the next one is often great. you've learned, youre back on the horse

### Skill Distribution
* focus on the technologies you like the most
    * its a marketable skill
    * it shows you have the ability to learn a new technology
    * and the dedication to learn it through and through
* DON'T try to 'take technologies on dates'
    * during job search, don't be tempted to try and add on extra tech to what you're learning

### Back vs. Front End
* front end jobs are more available and easier to get into
    * often roles will be full-stack or front-end
    * you can use these roles to leverage entry into the end you'd prefer
* don't FAKE it though, if you hate back/front end don't act like you love it
    * won't be a good fit for you or the company
